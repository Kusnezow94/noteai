Shared Dependencies:

1. **Data Schemas**: The `models.py` file will define the data schemas for the application. These schemas will be used across multiple files such as `views.py`, `serializers.py`, `apiService.js`, and `authService.js`.

2. **API Endpoints**: Defined in `urls.py` and used in `views.py`, `apiService.js`, and `authService.js`.

3. **Services**: The services defined in `transcription_service.py`, `summarization_service.py`, `storage_service.py`, and `authentication_service.py` will be used in `views.py`.

4. **React Components**: The components defined in `Login.js`, `Register.js`, `Dashboard.js`, `NoteDetail.js`, and `NoteCard.js` will be used in `App.js`.

5. **State Management**: The state management setup in `store/index.js` will be used across multiple frontend files such as `App.js`, `Login.js`, `Register.js`, `Dashboard.js`, `NoteDetail.js`, `NoteCard.js`, `apiService.js`, and `authService.js`.

6. **Actions and Reducers**: Defined in `actions.js` and `reducers.js`, these will be used in `store/index.js` and across multiple frontend files.

7. **DOM Element IDs**: These will be defined in the React component files (`Login.js`, `Register.js`, `Dashboard.js`, `NoteDetail.js`, `NoteCard.js`) and used in the corresponding JavaScript files.

8. **Package Dependencies**: Defined in `package.json` and used across all frontend files.

9. **Backend Configuration**: Defined in `settings.py` and `app.py`, and used across all backend files.

10. **Function Names**: Functions defined in one file may be used in another. For example, functions defined in `services` files will be used in `views.py`, and functions defined in `actions.js` and `reducers.js` will be used in various frontend files.
